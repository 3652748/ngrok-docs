# Kubernetes Operator

## Overview

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is the best way to use ngrok if your
applications run in Kubernetes environments. It supports both [Ingress CRDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) as well as the new [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is deployed to a cluster and allows developers to self-service public endpoints to their apps and services using a shared ngrok account.
