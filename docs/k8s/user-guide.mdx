# User Guide

The guide contains information on how to use the ngrok Kubernetes Operator. This is the place to start if you have the operator installed and want to use it to add ingress, gateways, routes, and other ngrok features to your clusters' apps and services.

Start by reading the [ingress-to-edge-relationship](/docs/k8s/with-edges.mdx) documentation to understand how ingress, gateway, and route objects are converted into ngrok edges.

For more advanced cases and usages, see the following:

- [Route Modules](./route-modules)
- [Custom Domain](./custom-domain)
- [CRDs](./crds)
- [TLS and HTTPS](./tls-and-https)
- [IP Restrictions](./ip-restrictions)

For see or contribute a specific example, file a PR in the [examples section of our repo see](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/docs/examples/README.md).
